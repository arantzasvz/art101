		<h1> Lab 5: Data Types and Variables <h1/>
		<p> This lab was focused on experimenting with JavaScript and variables. </p>
		<h2> Challenges <h2/>
		<p> One of the challenges I had for this Lab was not being able to get the Javascript commands to show up on my index.html and after a lot of asking in the discord Wes made it clear to me that when I referenced the variables I input them all as lowercase and in my code I capitalized the variables so the site wasn't able to recognize them. So after changing the variables to lowercase my results came and it worked! </p>
		<h2> Results <h2/>
		<p> Below is shown how I was able to fix the variables to all lowercase and getting the correct output.</p>
