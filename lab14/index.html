		<h2> Challenges and Problems </h2>
		<p> For this lab we debugged our Lab 8 that we had turned in as incomplete. A challenges we had for lab 8 was not being able to get the correct output for our arrays. After looking over this lab again and basically just restarting everything and deleting our previous javascript code we noticed that a lot of the issues we had came from labeling our functions incorrectly and having a lot of inconsistency among the functions. We were able to fix this by going back and labelling our functions all the same thing and being consistent with them as well as we were able to better understand how to get the true/false outputs.</p>
