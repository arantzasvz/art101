            <h1>Lab 10: <span id="title">JavaScript Events and Forms</span></h1>
            <p>Getting functions to work with user input and experimenting with JS events.</p>
            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p> We had difficulties adding the same JS elements from Lab 7 and getting them to work. We figured this issue by fixing our HTML and connecting the ID and from that got the correct output and all our JS elements worked.</p>
            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>We succesfully got the button to work and come out with the correct output that rearranges the users name. Enter your name to see it work!</p>

              <button id="my-button">submit</button>
