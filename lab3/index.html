		<h1>All about me! (Arantza Vilchis-Zarate) </h1>
		<p>I am a 3rd year Latin American and Latino studies major. I was born and raised in Los Angeles and have always loved living in the city. I have 3 dogs named Chippy, Cali, and Nacho, I also have a cat named Riot. Some of my favorite foods include sushi, pasta, and my moms homemade food:p. On my free time I enjoy going to the beach, hanging out with my friends, thrifting, and taking film photos. </p>
